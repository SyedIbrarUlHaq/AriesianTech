**Task 1: Population Growth Analysis in Pakistan**


**Objective:**

Analyze population growth in Pakistan at various administrative levels to understand rural and urban population trends and annual growth rates.

**Dataset:**

•	**Source:** Kaggle

•	**Features:**

o	Province, Division, District, Sub-Division
     
o	Area, Rural/Urban Population (1998), Sex Ratio, Growth Rate, Household Size
     
**Process:**

1.	**Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values and ensured consistency.
	
2.	**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   
     o	Visualized population distribution across provinces and sub-divisions.
  	
     o	Analyzed rural vs urban growth rates.
  	
     o	Calculated total population growth from 1998 to the most recent year in the dataset.
  	
3.	**Insights:** Identified regions with the highest growth and discussed potential impacts on resources, infrastructure, and development.
   
**Tools Used:**

Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn



**Task 2: Retail Sales Data Analysis**


**Objective:**

Analyze sales data from a retail company to uncover trends, peak sales periods, and popular products, and make strategic recommendations.


**Datasets:**

2.	**Sales Trends Analysis:**
   
o	Identified peak sales periods (holidays, seasonal trends).

o	Analyzed product-wise sales and store-wise performance.

3.	**Visualizations:**
   
o	Time-series analysis of weekly sales trends.

o	Product-wise sales distribution to identify best-selling items.

4.	**Insights and Recommendations:** Suggested promotional strategies for peak periods and highlighted top-performing products for focused marketing.
   
**Tools Used:**

Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
