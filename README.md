**Task 1: Population Growth Analysis in Pakistan**


**Objective:**

Analyze population growth in Pakistan at various administrative levels to understand rural and urban population trends and annual growth rates.

**Dataset:**

•	**Source:** Kaggle

•	**Features:**

o	Province, Division, District, Sub-Division
     
o	Area, Rural/Urban Population (1998), Sex Ratio, Growth Rate, Household Size
     
**Process:**

1.	**Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values and ensured consistency.
	
2.	**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   
     o	Visualized population distribution across provinces and sub-divisions.
  	
     o	Analyzed rural vs urban growth rates.
  	
     o	Calculated total population growth from 1998 to the most recent year in the dataset.
  	
3.	**Insights:** Identified regions with the highest growth and discussed potential impacts on resources, infrastructure, and development.
   
**Tools Used:**

Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn



**Task 2: Retail Sales Data Analysis**


**Objective:**

Analyze sales data from a retail company to uncover trends, peak sales periods, and popular products, and make strategic recommendations.


**Datasets:**


1.	Features Data Set
	
2.	Sales Data Set
	
3.	Stores Data Set

**Process:**

1.	**Data Merging:** Combined the datasets on common keys like store IDs.
    
2.	**Sales Trends Analysis:**
   
o	Identified peak sales periods (holidays, seasonal trends).

o	Analyzed product-wise sales and store-wise performance.

3.	**Visualizations:**
   
o	Time-series analysis of weekly sales trends.

o	Product-wise sales distribution to identify best-selling items.

4.	**Insights and Recommendations:** Suggested promotional strategies for peak periods and highlighted top-performing products for focused marketing.
   
**Tools Used:**

Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly




**Task 3: 80 Cereals Data Analysis**


**Objective:**

Conduct an in-depth analysis of the nutritional values of cereals to understand their impact on consumer ratings.


**Dataset:**

•	**Source:** Kaggle - 80 Cereals

•	**Features:**

o	Name, Calories, Protein, Fat, Sodium, Fiber, Carbohydrates, Sugars, Potassium, Vitamins, Shelf, Rating


**Process:**

**1.	Data Cleaning:** Addressed missing values and fixed data types.

**2.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

o	Examined distribution of nutritional values such as sugar content, fiber, calories, etc.

o	Analyzed correlation between nutritional values and cereal ratings.

**3.	Visualizations:**

o	Heatmap of correlations between different nutritional features and ratings.

o	Histograms and bar plots for key features like sugar, calories, and fiber.

**4.	Insights:** Found a significant correlation between high sugar content and low ratings, highlighting the cereals with better nutritional value.


**Tools Used:**

Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn




**Task 4: Tour & Travel Customer Churn Prediction**


**Objective:**

Build predictive models to identify customers likely to churn, helping the company optimize resources and retention strategies.


**Dataset:**


•	**Source:** Kaggle

•	**Features:**

o	Age, Frequent Flyer Status, Annual Income Class, Services Opted, Account Synced to Social Media, Booked Hotel, Target (Churn/No Churn)

	
**Process:**


1.	**Data Cleaning:** Ensured the dataset was free from missing or incorrect values.

2.	**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   
o	Visualized the distribution of features (age, income class, etc.) and their relation to churn.
  	
o	Analyzed churn distribution and identified significant churn indicators.
  	
3.	**Modeling:**
   
o	Built and trained a Logistic Regression model and a Random Forest Classifier to predict churn.
  	
o	Evaluated models using accuracy, confusion matrices, and classification reports.
  	
4.	**Results:** The Random Forest model performed better, accurately identifying customers likely to churn based on provided indicators.

   
**Tools Used:**
Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
